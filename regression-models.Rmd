# Executive Summary
This is a report prepared as part of the coursework required for the Coursera Regression Models course. The instructions for this report assignment state as follows:  

  You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:  
  
*- Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?*  

*- Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions*  


  
We will use the mtcars dataset, as documented at the following link: <https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html>  
  
  
  Our analysis demonstrates the following:  
  
  1.Manual transmission will yield better miles per gallon, when compared with Automatic. On average, a manual car will achieve 24 mpg, versus 17 mpg for automatics.  

  2.Further analysis shows a correlation between MPG and the following confounding variables:  

 -wt (Weight). The greater the weight of the car, the less MPG  

 -cyl (number of engine cylinders)

# Data analysis
We load the data set, and perform an initial plot of Transmission Types:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(mtcars)
mtcars$vs <- factor(mtcars$vs)
mtcars$am.label <- factor(mtcars$am, labels=c("Automatic","Manual")) # 0=automatic, 1=manual
mtcars$gear <- factor(mtcars$gear)
mtcars$carb <- factor(mtcars$carb)
head(mtcars)
```
```{r}
boxplot(mpg ~ am.label, data = mtcars, col = (c("green","yellow")), ylab = "Miles Per Gallon", xlab = "Transmission Type")

```



  We can see from the boxplot that Manual Transmission provides better MPG. We will analyze this further in the remaining sections
  
# Regression Analysis
We can also calculate mean MPG values for cars with Automatic and Manual transmission as follows:
```{r}
aggregate(mtcars$mpg,by=list(mtcars$am.label),FUN=mean)
```
We can see again that Manual transmission yields on average 7 MPG more than Automatic, Let’s now test this hypothesis with a Simple Linear Regression Test:
```{r}
T_simple <- lm(mpg ~ factor(am), data=mtcars)
summary(T_simple)
```
The p-value is less than 0.0003, so we will not reject the hypothesis. However, the R-squared value for this test is only ~= .35, suggesting that only a third or so of variance in MPG can be attributed to transmission type alone. Let’s perform an Analysis of Variance for the data:
```{r}
T_variance_analysis <- aov(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars)
summary(T_variance_analysis)
```
From the above Analysis of Variance, we can look for p-values of less than .5. This gives us cyl, disp, and wt to consider in addition to transmission type (am)
```{r}
T_multivar <- lm(mpg ~ cyl + disp + wt + am, data = mtcars)
summary(T_multivar)
```
This Multivariable Regression test now gives us an R-squared value of over .83, suggesting that 83% or more of variance can be explained by the multivariable model. P-values for cyl (number of cylinders) and weight are below 0.5, suggesting that these are confounding variables in the relation between car Transmission Type and Miles per Gallon.

# Residual Plot and analysis
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(T_multivar)
```


  The “Residuals vs Fitted” plot here shows us that the residuals are homoscedastic. We can also see that they are normally distributed, with the exception of a few outliers.
